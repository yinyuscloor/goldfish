# Goldfish Scheme / [金鱼 Scheme](README_ZH.md)
> Make Scheme as easy to use and practical as Python!

Goldfish Scheme is a Scheme interpreter with the following features:
+ R7RS-small compatible
+ Scala-like functional collection
+ Python-like versatile standard library
+ Small and fast

## Demo Code
### Named parameter
``` scheme
(define* (person (name "Bob") (age 21))
  (string-append name ": " (number->string age)))

(person :name "Alice" :age 3)
```
### Unicode Support
``` scheme
(import (liii lang))

($ "你好，世界" 0) ; => 你
($ "你好，世界" 4) ; => 界
($ "你好，世界" :length) ; => 5
```

### Functional Data Pipeline
![](r7rs_vs_goldfish.png)

With `prime?` provided, filter twin prime numbers in this way:
``` scheme
(import (liii lang))

(($ 1 :to 100)
 :filter prime?
 :filter (lambda (x) (prime? (+ x 2)))
 :map (lambda (x) (cons x (+ x 2)))
 :collect)
```

### Scala like case class
``` scheme
(define-case-class person
  ((name string?)
   (age integer?))

  (define (%to-string)
    (string-append "I am " name " " (number->string age) " years old!"))
  (define (%greet x)
    (string-append "Hi " x ", " (%to-string))))

(define bob (person "Bob" 21))

(bob :to-string) ; => "I am Bob 21 years old!"
(bob :greet "Alice") ; => "Hi Alice, I am Bob 21 years old!"
```

> **Performance Warning**: `define-case-class` is implemented via macros and has significant performance overhead. It is suitable for hand-written code and prototyping, but **not recommended for AI-generated code or production deployments**.

## Simplicity is Beauty
Goldfish Scheme still follows the same principle of simplicity as S7 Scheme. Currently, Goldfish Scheme only depends on [S7 Scheme](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/software/s7/), [tbox](https://gitee.com/tboox/tbox) and C++ standard library defined in C++ 98.

Just like S7 Scheme, [src/goldfish.hpp](src/goldfish.hpp) and [src/goldfish.cpp](src/goldfish.cpp) are the only key source code needed to build the goldfish interpreter binary.

## Installation
Goldfish Scheme is bundled in Mogan Research (since v1.2.8), just [install Mogan Research](https://mogan.app/guide/Install.html) to install Goldfish Scheme.

Besides the Goldfish Scheme interpreter, a nice structured [Goldfish Scheme REPL](https://mogan.app/guide/plugin_goldfish.html) is availabe in Mogan Research.

The following guide will help you build and install Goldfish step by step.

### GNU/Linux
Here are commandlines to build it on Debian bookworm:
```
sudo apt install xmake git unzip curl g++
git clone https://gitee.com/LiiiLabs/goldfish.git
# git clone https://github.com/LiiiLabs/goldfish.git
cd goldfish
xmake b goldfish
bin/gf --version
```
You can also install it to `/opt`:
```
sudo xmake i -o /opt/goldfish --root
/opt/goldfish/bin/gf
```
For uninstallation, just:
```
sudo rm -rf /opt/goldfish
```

### macOS
Here are commandlines to build it on macOS:
```
brew tap MoganLab/goldfish
brew install goldfish
```
For uninstallation, just:
```
brew uninstall goldfish
```

## Commandlinefu
This section assumes you have executed `xmake b goldfish` sucessfully and `bin/gf` is available.

### Subcommands

Goldfish Scheme uses subcommands for different operations:

| Subcommand | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `help` | Display help message |
| `version` | Display version information |
| `eval CODE` | Evaluate Scheme code |
| `load FILE` | Load Scheme file and enter REPL |
| `repl` | Enter interactive REPL mode |
| `run TARGET` | Run main function from target |
| `test` | Run tests |
| `fix PATH` | Format Scheme code |
| `FILE` | Load and evaluate Scheme file directly |

### Display Help
Without any command, it will print the help message:
```
> bin/gf
Goldfish Scheme 17.11.32 by LiiiLabs

Commands:
  help               Display this help message
  version            Display version
  eval CODE          Evaluate Scheme code
  load FILE          Load Scheme code from FILE, then enter REPL
  ...
```

### Display Version
`version` subcommand will print the Goldfish Scheme version and the underlying S7 Scheme version:
```
> bin/gf version
Goldfish Scheme 17.11.32 by LiiiLabs
based on S7 Scheme 11.5 (22-Sep-2025)
```

### Evaluate Code
`eval` subcommand helps you evaluate Scheme code on the fly:
```
> bin/gf eval "(+ 1 2)"
3
> bin/gf eval "(begin (import (srfi srfi-1)) (first (list 1 2 3)))"
1
> bin/gf eval "(begin (import (liii sys)) (display (argv)) (newline))" 1 2 3
("bin/gf" "eval" "(begin (import (liii sys)) (display (argv)) (newline))" "1" "2" "3")
```

### Load File
`load` subcommand helps you load a Scheme file and enter REPL:
```
> bin/gf load tests/goldfish/liii/base-test.scm
; load the file and enter REPL
```

### Run File Directly
You can also load and evaluate a Scheme file directly:
```
> bin/gf tests/goldfish/liii/base-test.scm
; *** checks *** : 1973 correct, 0 failed.
```

### Mode Option
`-m` or `--mode` helps you specify the standard library mode:

+ `default`: `-m default` is the equiv of `-m liii`
+ `liii`: Goldfish Scheme with `(liii oop)`, `(liii base)` and `(liii error)`
+ `scheme`: Goldfish Scheme with `(liii base)` and `(liii error)`
+ `sicp`: S7 Scheme with `(scheme base)` and `(srfi sicp)`
+ `r7rs`: S7 Scheme with `(scheme base)`
+ `s7`: S7 Scheme without any extra library


## Versioning
Goldfish Scheme x.y.z means that it is using the tbox x, based on S7 Scheme y, and z is the patch version. To clarify, the second version of Goldfish Scheme is `17.10.1`, it means that it is using `tbox 1.7.x`, based on `S7 Scheme 10.x`, the patch version is `1`.

## Why we created Goldfish Scheme
Goldfish Scheme is implemented to overcome the defects of [S7 Scheme](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/software/s7/):
1. Distribute the ready-to-use Goldfish Scheme interpreter and structured REPL on Linux/macOS/Windows
2. Try to implement the [R7RS-small](https://small.r7rs.org) standard
3. Try to provide the useful SRFI in R7RS library format
